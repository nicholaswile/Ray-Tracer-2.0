# Ray-Tracer-2.0

Last year I built a Ray Tracer using C++ with the Windows API to draw pixels to the console. This year I've decided to create another (and hopefully more sophisticated) Ray Tracer, this time using C++ with SDL. 

This is a work in progress currently in development.

For now I'm gonna focus on the spheres, but eventually I'd like to use this towards rendering 3D models comprised of triangle meshes.
